= About java-ee6-examples

Explore Java EE 6 by examples
	You will find Maven based projects that explore some of major EE 6 
	components or specs	with working code examples. Most of the examples 
	are developed and run on Glassfish Server.
	
	The purpose of this project is just for my own learning and exploration.
	You may use	these as tutorial and further explore the EE stack yourself.

= Dependencies
We will try to not use any dependencies jar for these example applications. 
However you would need the MySQL driver jars and install that into application
server and setup DataSource in order to deploy some of the sub modules.
