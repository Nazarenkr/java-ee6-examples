Explore Java EE 6 by examples
	You will find Maven based projects that explore some of major EE 6 components or specs
	with working code examples. Most of the examples are developed and run on Glassfish Server.
	
	The purpose of this project is just for my own learning and exploration. You may use
	these as tutorial and further explore the EE stack yourself.
